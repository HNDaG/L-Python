Logical Operators

and 	Returns True if both statements are true	x < 5 and  x < 10	
or	Returns True if one of the statements is true	x < 5 or x < 4	
not	Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true	not(x < 5 and x < 10)
'''
'''
Identity Operators

is 	Returns True if both variables are the same object	x is y	
is not	Returns True if both variables are not the same object	x is not y

print(x is z)
# returns True because z is the same object as x
print(x is y)
# returns False because x is not the same object as y, even if they have the same content
print(x == y)
# to demonstrate the difference betweeen "is" and "==": this comparison returns True because x is equal to y

"""
Python Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operators are used to compare (binary) numbers:

Operator	Name	Description
& 	AND	Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1
|	OR	Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1
 ^	XOR	Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1
~ 	NOT	Inverts all the bits
<<	Zero fill left shift	Shift left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off
>>	Signed right shift	Shift right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off
